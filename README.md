Introduction

Spheroid is an Arbitrum orbit based L2 blockchain solution tailored specifically for commerce and aims to enhance the security, transparency and efficiency of commercial transactions by providing a dedicated infrastructure for merchants and consumers. Spheroid addresses key challenges in the commerce sector, including security vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance and user experience complexities

Core features

KYC integration: Mandatory KYC for all users and merchants to ensure trust and regulatory compliance on the platform and to prevent fraud and illicit activities

Merchant registry: Merchants can register on a global registry, ensuring a standardized and transparent onboarding process for all users and merchants and enabling users to verify the authenticity of merchants before making transactions with them

Walletless: Traditional crypto wallets are known to create a 72%+ drop off in user adoption as they require users to download plugins, follow a series of complex setups, and confusing popups, require users to understand and safely store seed phrases, and their UX, in general, is hard for non-technical users. Hence we are building Spheroid as a walletless blockchain that abstracts away these complexities with chain abstraction implemented at a core and protocol level

Loyalty: Merchants can issue loyalty tokens directly onchain (instead of using centralized databases), enabling secure and transparent reward systems, as well as the points/rewards remain tradable or transferable without permissions from the merchant or any other third party

Payments and Settlements: With cryptocurrency, payments can be facilitated and settled instantly, reducing transaction times from days to seconds, and with the onramp-offramp functionality both merchants and consumers can spend or accept money in any currency they want from any part of the world without worrying about the conversion rates or the fees associated with it

Loans: Users can access loans through DeFi mechanisms, improving financial flexibility and supporting commerce growth (already proven effective in ecommerce with services like BNPL, personal loans etc)

Anti money laundering (AML) compliance: AML checks are conducted at the sequencer stage before transactions are submitted to the chain, ensuring regulatory compliance and preventing illicit activities

Disputes: We utilize smart contracts to enforce terms of agreements automatically, minimizing the need for intermediaries in dispute resolution, and all the resolutions remain secure and transparent which can be challenged later if needed

Taxation: We integrate automated tax calculation tools that comply with regional tax regulations and ensure all tax and invoicing processes adhere to local and international regulations, ensuring accurate and timely tax reporting for merchants

Invoicing: Spheroid generates immutable and transparent invoices, facilitating easier auditing and compliance for both merchants and users and ensuring that all transactions are recorded and traceable
